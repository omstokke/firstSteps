My first steps into Python3

The starting date for my journey into Python3 was 27.03.2021, start of Easter 2021. Mind you, it had to compete with Zelda: BotW on Switch and a translation of Arabic hiakus into Norwegian (see "Hello-World").

First steps: Youtube and Google some tutorials to watch, and learn.

Simple rules: Copy instructions and code, smaller prompts and challenges from the tutorials - but do not copy blindly larger construction and projects. As long as the basic functions and building blocks are understood, use tutorials as inspiration, but don't copy the same scope and result (try to expand).

The following files are notes I took watching the following tutorials on Youtube:
  - NullPointerException / FreeCodeCamp: Introduction to Programming and Computer Science - Full Course (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOjov-2OZ0E)
  - Mosh: Python Tutorial for Beginners - Learn Python in 1 Hour (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8)
  - Mike from Giraffe Academy / FreeCodeCamp: Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw)
  - Mosh: Python Tutorial - Python for Beginners [Full Course] - Stop after 03:55:something so as not to start copying projects directly (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc)
